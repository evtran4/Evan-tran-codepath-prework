## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Since i primarly use VScode, I had a bit of a hard time adjusting to Xcode

## App Brainstorming
    Favorite apps:
    - VScode
        - Ability to code and easily add extensions
        - Customizable themes 
    - Gmail
        - Organizing messages with different labels
        - Scheduling messages
    - Discord
        - Very customizable chatrooms
        - Easy multi-person calls (voice chats)
        - Compatible with many platforms (Xbox, PC,...)

An app I want to build would be a bill-splitting app, simplifying the process of 
splitting reasturant bills among friends by having one person pay, and facilitating 
payments for the other members towards the one who paid. This would save time and 
resources for the reasturant, as well as ensure everyone is paid back properly. Some features I would like to implement would be an image to text scanner where the payer could scan their bill and have each item and their respective prices be seprated into buttons, allowing each member of the party to select what they want to pay for. Another feature I would like to implement is the integration of Apple Pay into the app, allowing the other memebrs to directly pay without having to navigate, and the app to document all pending or past transactions.
